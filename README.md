hipe-code
=========

Personal HIPE code - probably meaningless to most other people (HIPE is the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment, designed for the processing of Herschel data)

This is not a collaborative project, and so is probably not very useful to others.

There is also lots of half-written code in there, so might seem like a bit of a mess...
